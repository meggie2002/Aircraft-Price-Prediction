# Aircraft Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

The aircraft price varies by their engine type, power, fuel capacity,
speed, weight, distance range and other parameters. Prices for 518
different aircraft are given in aircraft_price.csv file. The dataset
includes 517 aircraft records with 14 quantitative variables and 2
qualitative variables. Quantitative Variables are measured on a
continuous ratio scale (e.g., speed in knots, weight in pounds, price in
dollars) and Qualitative Variables are measured on a nominal scale
(e.g., engine type as piston or other). The dataset contains a variety
of aircraft performance and specification data, which could be useful
for price prediction.

The explained variable is:

1.  price: in US dollars (Quantitative variable)

The explanatory variables are:

1.  model_name: Name of the aircraft model.

2.  engine_type: Type of the engine. (Qualitative variable)

3.  engine_power: Power of the engine. (hp)

4.  max_speed: Maximum speed of the aircraft. (Knots(kt))

5.  cruise_speed: Cruise speed of the aircraft. (Knots(kt))

6.  stall_speed: Minimum speed of the aircraft to prevent
    stalling.(Knots(kt))

7.  fuel_tank: Fuel tank capacity of the aircraft. (gallons(gal))

8.  all_eng_roc: All Engine Rate of Climb. The maximum altitude of the
    aircraft at full power. (feet/min)

9.  out_eng_roc: Out Engine Rate of Climb. The maximum altitude of the
    aircraft at out power. (feet/min)

10. takeoff_distance: The minimum distance required for an aircraft to
    take off. (feet)

11. landing_distance: The minimum distance required for an aircraft to
    land. (feet)

12. empty_weight: Empty weight of the aircraft. (pounds(lbs))

13. length: Length of the aircraft. (inch)

14. wing_span: Wingspan of the aircraft. (inch)

15. range: Range of the aircraft. (nmi)

```{r read csv file}
# Read the aircraft data from the csv file
Aircraft = read.csv("C:/603/aircraft_price.csv")
print(head(Aircraft))
```

## 1. Cleaning the Aircraft data

Check the Aircraft data for any missing values and then remove rows with
missing data to create a cleaned version of the data set. It ensures
that the cleaned Aircraft data has complete information in every row so
you can analyze it without any gaps in data.

```{r Data Cleaning}
# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(Aircraft))

# Remove rows with any missing values
AircraftData <- na.omit(Aircraft)
print(head(AircraftData))
```

## 2. Create first order model

First order model for predicting the Aircraft price is generated with
the all the explanatory variables excluding the model name.

```{r First Order Model}
firstordermodel = lm(price ~factor(engine_type)+engine_power + 
                       max_speed + cruise_speed +stall_speed + 
                       fuel_tank + all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + 
                       takeoff_distance + landing_distance + 
                       empty_weight + length + wing_span + range,
             data = AircraftData)
summary(firstordermodel)
```

## 3. Checking the Regression Assumptions

### 3.1. Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly
correlated, which can distort the coefficients in a regression model. We
are testing for Multicollinearity with the following techniques:

1.  Pairs plot

2.  Variance Inflation Factors (VIF).(VIF \> 5 → Moderate
    multicollinearity. VIF \> 10 → Severe multicollinearity.)

#### 3.1.1 Multicollinearity: Pairs plot

Let's plot the most correlated predictors:

```{r Multicollinearity-Pairs plot}
pairs(~ price + engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed +stall_speed + 
                       fuel_tank + all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + landing_distance + 
                       empty_weight + length + wing_span + range, data = AircraftData)
```

From the above output we can see that there exists correlation for
engine_power with landing_distance, empty_weight and fuel_tank
respectively. Also there exists a correlation between wing_span and
length.

#### 3.1.2 Multicollinearity: Variance Inflation Factors

So let's find the VIF for the variables.

```{r Multicollinearity-VIF}
#2. Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)
imcdiag(firstordermodel, method="VIF")
vif(firstordermodel)
```

From the output we can see that landing_distance has highest VIF.
According to the VIF values, we can list the highest multicollinearity
items as below:

Severe Multicollinearity (VIF/GVIF \> 10):

1.  landing_distance (VIF=165.28, GVIF=165.28)

2.  empty_weight (VIF=138.62, GVIF=138.62)

3.  fuel_tank (VIF=30.52, GVIF=30.52)

4.  engine_power (VIF=27.91, GVIF=27.91)

5.  length (VIF=21.50, GVIF=21.50)

6.  factor(engine_type)Piston (VIF=12.51, GVIF=16.14)

7.  cruise_speed (VIF=10.05, GVIF=10.05)

Moderate/Low Collinearity (VIF/GVIF \< 10): All other variables
(e.g.,max_speed, wing_span, range) are safe to retain. GVIF (Generalized
Variance Inflation Factor) adjusts for categorical predictors like
engine_type. For categorical variables with Df \> 1, e.g., engine_type
has 2 levels, GVIF\^(1/(2\*Df)) is interpreted. Here,
factor(engine_type) has GVIF\^(1/4) = 2.00 → Acceptable (under common
thresholds).

So remove the most correlated variables Priority Order:

First: landing_distance (VIF=165.28)

Second: empty_weight (VIF=138.62)

Third: fuel_tank (VIF=30.52)

Fourth: length (VIF=21.50)

Since enigne_power, Cruise_speed and engine_type are statistically and
theoretically significant, we cannot remove them. Below code removes the
variables in the highest collinearity order.

```{r Removing Multicollinearity}

                       fuel_tank + all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + landing_distance + 
                       empty_weight + length + wing_span + range, data = AircraftData)

summary(model8)
imcdiag(model7, method="VIF")
```

Proceeding with model 5, since the multicollinearity removed.

```{r Model with no Multicollinearity}
model5 = lm(price ~factor(engine_type)+engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed +stall_speed + 
                       all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + wing_span + range, data = AircraftData)

                       all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + wing_span + range, data = AircraftData)
```

## 4. MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURES

### 4.1. Stepwise Selection Procedure

```{r Stepwise Selection Procedure}
fullmodel = lm(price ~ engine_type + engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed +stall_speed + 
                       all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + wing_span + range, data = AircraftData)

stepmod=ols_step_both_p(fullmodel,p_enter = 0.05, p_remove = 0.1, details=TRUE)
summary(stepmod$model)
stepmod$metrics$adj_r2
```

Best additive model using the Stepwise selection procedure is as
follows:

$\widehat{\text{price}}$ = 693659.32 - 661350.47X~engine_typePiston~ -
527735.55X~engine_typePropjet~ - 115.72X~engine_power~ +
1571.61X~max_speed~ + 4963.33X~cruise_speed~ + 5401.47X~stall_speed~ +
1104.12X~wing_span~ + 159.60X~range~

### 4.2. Forward Selection Procedure

```{r Forward Selection Procedure}
ExecPriceFor=ols_step_forward_p(fullmodel,p_val = 0.05, details=TRUE)
summary(ExecPriceFor$model)
ExecPriceFor$metrics$adj_r2
```

Best additive model using the Forward selection procedure is as follows:

$\widehat{\text{price}}$ = 693659.32 - 661350.47X~engine_typePiston~ -
527735.55X~engine_typePropjet~ - 115.72X~engine_power~ +
1571.61X~max_speed~ + 4963.33X~cruise_speed~ + 5401.47X~stall_speed~ +
1104.12X~wing_span~ + 159.60X~range~

### 4.3. Backwards Elimination

```{r Backwards Elimination 1}
ExecPriceBack=ols_step_backward_p(fullmodel, p_val = 0.05, details=TRUE)
summary(ExecPriceBack$model)
```

Best additive model using the Backwards elimination procedure is as
follows:

$\widehat{\text{price}}$ = 693659.32 - 661350.47X~engine_typePiston~ -
527735.55X~engine_typePropjet~ - 115.72X~engine_power~ +
1571.61X~max_speed~ + 4963.33X~cruise_speed~ + 5401.47X~stall_speed~ +

```{r Backwards Elimination 2}
ExecPriceBack$metrics
ExecPriceBack$metrics$adj_r2
```

### 4.4. All-Possible-Regressions Selection Procedure

```{r All-Possible-Regressions Selection1: Option1}
#option 1
ExecSubsets=ols_step_best_subset(fullmodel, details=TRUE)
ExecSubsets$metrics
```

Using option1(olsrr package): The 7th model is the best model, with CP =
10.15265 and AIC = 14431.78(smallest AIC) and predictors are:
engine_type, engine_power, max_speed, cruise_speed, stall_speed,
wing_span & range.

```{r All-Possible-Regressions Selection1: Option 1}
#option 1 Continued
rsquare=c((ExecSubsets$metrics)$rsquare)
AdjustedR=c((ExecSubsets$metrics)$adjr)
cp=c((ExecSubsets$metrics)$cp)
AIC=c((ExecSubsets$metrics)$aic)
cbind(rsquare,AdjustedR,cp,AIC)
```

```{r All-Possible-Regressions Selection2: Option2}
#option 2: using leaps package
best.subsetFullModel=regsubsets(price ~ engine_type + engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed +stall_speed + 
                       all_eng_roc + out_eng_roc + takeoff_distance + wing_span + range, data= AircraftData, nv=10 )
summary(best.subsetFullModel)
```

```{r All-Possible-Regressions Selection2: Option 2}
reg.summary=summary(best.subsetFullModel)
rsquare=c(reg.summary$rsq)
cp=c(reg.summary$cp)
AdjustedR=c(reg.summary$adjr2)
RSS=c(reg.summary$rss)
BIC=c(reg.summary$bic)
cbind(rsquare,cp,BIC,RSS,AdjustedR)
```

Using the option2(with leaps package): The model with AdjustedR2 =
0.8728655, Mallow'sCP = 10.15265, BIC = -997.7155 is the best predictor
and predictors are: engine_type, engine_power, max_speed, cruise_speed,
stall_speed, wing_span & range.

Thus we can conclude that our best additive model as: price \~
engine_type + engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed +
wing_span + range

## 5. Interaction model building

In the next step, we will build interaction models based on best
additive model.

```{r Interaction model}
interactPriceFull = lm(price ~ (factor(engine_type) + engine_power + max_speed + 
                                  cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span + range)^2,  data = AircraftData)

summary(interactPriceFull)

#insignificant terms are removed and new model is created
interacModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + max_speed + 
                        cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +  range +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

summary(interacModel)

#insignicant terms removed from the above interaction model: range
bestInteracModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + max_speed + 
                        cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

summary(bestInteracModel)
```

bestInteracModel =\> price \~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power +
max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span + factor(engine_type)
\* engine_power + factor(engine_type) \* max_speed + factor(engine_type)
\* cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) \* wing_span +\
engine_power \* max_speed + engine_power \* cruise_speed + engine_power
\* wing_span + max_speed \* wing_span + cruise_speed \* stall_speed

We have to test which model is to be taken as the best interaction
model. So we can perform an ANOVA test. H~0~: the reduced model is the
best H~1~: the full interaction model is the best

```{r Interaction model ANOVA test}
anova(bestInteracModel, interactPriceFull)
```

From the above output, we can see that the p-value = 0.06086 \>
aplha(0.05). So we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There for we can
say that the reduced model is the best.

## 6. Introduce higher order terms in best interaction model

We can check if there is a possibility for higher order for the
predictors using the pairs plot.

```{r Higher order model: Pairs plot}
pairs(~price + factor(engine_type) +engine_power, data = AircraftData , panel  = panel.smooth)

pairs(~price + max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed, data = AircraftData, panel  = panel.smooth)

pairs(~price + wing_span + range ,data = AircraftData, panel  = panel.smooth)

pairs(~price + engine_power + max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span + range ,data = AircraftData, panel  = panel.smooth)
```

From the above output, we can see there might be a possibility for
higher orders for the variables: engine_power, max_speed and
cruise_speed.

### 6.1. Checking higher order term for engine_power

```{r Higher order model: engin_power}
# Checking I(engine_power^2)
higherOrder1 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(engine_power^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)
summary(higherOrder1)
```

Since I(engine_power\^2) is not significant with the p-value, we are
moving to next step.

### 6.2. Checking higher order term for max_speed

```{r Higher order model: max_speed}
# Checking I(max_speed^2)
higherOrderMaxSpeed2 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(max_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)


# Checking I(max_speed^3)
higherOrderMaxSpeed3 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(max_speed^2) + I(max_speed^3) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)


# Checking I(max_speed^4)
higherOrderMaxSpeed4 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(max_speed^2) + I(max_speed^3) + I(max_speed^4) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

summary(higherOrderMaxSpeed2)
summary(higherOrderMaxSpeed3)
summary(higherOrderMaxSpeed4)
```

The quartic term is not significant, So we proceed with the model with
cubic term.

### 6.3. Checking higher order term for cruise_speed

```{r Higher order model: cruise_speed}
# Checking I(cruise_speed^2)
higherOrderCruiseSpeed2 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)


# Checking I(cruise_speed^3)
higherOrderCruiseSpeed3 = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) + I(cruise_speed^3) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +

                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

summary(higherOrderCruiseSpeed2)
summary(higherOrderCruiseSpeed3)
```

The cubic term for cruise_speed is not significant, So we proceed with
the model with quadratic term.

### 6.4. Comparison of models with higher order terms to get the final best model

```{r Higher order model comparison}
summary(higherOrderMaxSpeed3)$adj.r.squared
sigma(higherOrderMaxSpeed3)

summary(higherOrderCruiseSpeed2)$adj.r.squared
sigma(higherOrderCruiseSpeed2)
```

Based on the ouput above: Adjusted r square is higher for
higherOrderCruiseSpeed2 model and RSE is lower,So we could say that the
higherOrderMaxSpeed3 is the best model.

So from all the above models we can conclude our best model as:

```

$\beta_0$= 5823241.56\
The price of an aircraft with jet engine type is \$5.8 million when all
the other predictors are zero.(This is not valid in real life
situations)

#### Main Effects of Qualitative variable:

$\beta_~(enginetype)Piston$= - 4388887.92 Aircraft with a Piston engine
are, on average, \$4.4 million cheaper than the aircrafts with Jet
engine type holding all other variables constant.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Propjet$= -2755059.51 The price of an aircraft with
a Propjet engine is \$2.8 million lesser than the jet engine type
aircrafts. Still cheaper, but not as much as a piston plane.

#### Main effects of Quantitative variable:

$\beta~cruise_speed^2$= 21 The squared term suggests a nonlinear
relationship between cruise speed and price. For a 1 unit increase in
cruise_speed, the price increases by 21\*$cruisespeed^2$, indicating
that price rises more steeply at higher cruise speeds.

$\beta~enginepower$= 1699.67\
A 1-horsepower increase in engine_power price jump by \$1,699.67,
reflecting the value of greater power.we know —stronger engines aren’t
cheap.

$\beta~maxspeed$= -3169.59\
For every 1 knot increase of max speed, the price drops by \$3,170.
usually Faster planes should cost more but here this effect is tangled
up with other factors we will get to—like interactions.

$\beta~cruisespeed$= -7505.68\
A 1-knot increase in cruise speed decreases price by
\$7,505.68.##########################checkkkkk

$\beta~stallspeed$= -17359.94\
If the stall speed goes up by a one knot, the price drops by \$17,360.

$\beta~wingspan$= -6490.75\
A 1-inch increase in wingspan decreases price by \$6,491.

### Main effect on Interaction Terms with Engine Type:

$\beta_~(enginetype)Piston*enginepower$= −981\
For Piston engines, each additional horsepower reduces the price
increase from engine_power by \$981 compared to the reference type. Net
effect for Piston: *1,699.67 − 981 = 718.67* dollars per horsepower.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Propjet*enginepower$= −2,284.54 For Propjet engines,
each horsepower reduces the price increase by \$2,284.54.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Piston*maxspeed$= 1,570.64\
For Piston engines, a 1-knot increase in max speed increases price by an
additional \$1,570.64 over the reference. Net effect: −3,169.59 +
1,570.64= −1,598.95 dollars per unit.With piston engines, an knot
increase of max speed cuts the price drop to \$1,599.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Propjet*maxspeed$= 5,697.49\
For Propjets, a 1-knot increase in max speed adds \$5,697.49 to the
price of the aircraft. Net effect:\
−3,169.59+5,697.49 = 2,527.90, indicating higher max speed boosts price
for Propjets.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Piston*cruisespeed$= 8,317.65\
For Piston engines, a 1-knot increase in cruise speed adds \$8,317.65.
Net effect: −7,505.68 + 8,317.65= 811.97 dollars per unit.Here, a knot
increase of cruise speed adds \$812 to the price for aircrafts with
piston engine.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Propjet*cruisespeed$= − 152.84\
For Propjets, a 1-knot increase reduces the cruise speed effect by
\$152.84. Net effect:\
−7,505.68 − 152.84= −7,658.52.For propjets, cruise speed still drags the
price down, by \$7,659 per knot.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Piston*wingspan$= 5,975.35\
For Piston engines, a 1-inch increase in wingspan adds \$5,975.35 to the
aircraft price.\
Net effect: −6,490.75+5,975.35= −515.40.piston planes soften the
wingspan price drop to about \$515 per inch.

$\beta_~(enginetype)Propjet*wingspan$= 5,967.59\
For Propjets, a 1-inch increase in wingspan increases the aircraft price
by \$5,967.59.\
Net effect: −6,490.75 + 5,967.59=−523.16.Propjet planes soften the
wingspan price drop to about \$515 per inch.

### Main effect of Quantitative Interaction Terms:

$\beta_~enginepower*maxspeed$= -1.27\
For a 1-knot increase in max speed, the effect of engine power on price
decreases by \$1.27 per horsepower.

$\beta_~enginepower*cruisespeed$= -3.21\
For a 1-knot increase in cruise speed, the effect of engine power on
aircraft price decreases by \$3.21 per horsepower.

$\beta_~enginepower*wingspan$= 0.43\
For a 1-inch increase in wingspan, the effect of engine power on
aircraft price increases by \$0.43 per horsepower.

$\beta_~maxspeed*wingspan$= 10.64\
For a 1-inch increase in wingspan, the effect of max speed on aircraft
price increases by \$10.64 per knot.

$\beta_~cruisespeed*stallspeed$= 49.2\
For a 1-knot increase in stall speed, the effect of cruise speed on
price of the aircraft increases by \$49.2 per knot.

### 6.6. Confidence Interval Estimation for best mdoel

```{r}
conf_intervals <- confint(bestModel, level = 0.95)
print(conf_intervals)
```

Our model identifies key drivers of aircraft price, with engine type, engine power, cruise speed, stall speed, and wing span playing significant roles. Engine power increases price, while stall speed and wing span tend to decrease it. Notably, Propjet aircraft benefit more from higher speeds and larger wingspans. The most significant predictors are cruise speed, engine power, and cruise speed squared. We are 95% confident that for every one-unit increase in cruise speed, price decreases by 1,660 to 13,300, while engine power increases price by 1,280 to 2,120 per unit. Additionally, the quadratic cruise speed term shows a nonlinear price effect, meaning price increases at higher cruise speeds but at a diminishing rate.

### 6.7. Prediction with Best model

```{r}
bestModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

newdata = data.frame(engine_type = "Piston",engine_power=300, max_speed =240, cruise_speed =200, stall_speed=70, wing_span=400)
predict(bestModel,newdata,interval="predict",level = .95)
```

The model predicts a fitted price of 2,324,571 USD for a piston-engine aircraft with the given specifications: engine_power = 300, max_speed = 240, cruise_speed = 200, stall_speed = 70, and wing_span = 400. The 95% prediction interval ranges from 1,765,506 USD to 2,883,635 USD.

## 7. Checking the remaining Regression Assumptions

### 7.1. Linearity Assumption

The linear regression model assumes that there is a straight-line
(linear) relationship between the predictors and the aircraft price. For
identifying the non linearity we are using the residual plot.

```{r Linearity Assumption}
#Residual Plot
bestModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

summary(bestModel)$adj.r.squared
sigma(bestModel)

ggplot(bestModel, aes(x=.fitted, y=.resid)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(color = "lightblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +  
  labs(title = "Residual vs fitted values",
       x = "Fitted",
       y = "Residual",
       color = "Method") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

There appears to be no pattern of the residuals at all. The 𝑅2𝑎𝑑𝑗 of the
bestModel is 0.9247535 indicates the variation in Price that can be
explained by this model is 92.48% with RMSE = 279449.2. We can conclude
that the above model named bestModel, is the best fit model to predict
Price among the models we considered.

We will now extract the residuals and plot this data to analyze the
histogram, qq plot, and residual vs fitted plot.

#### 7.2. Normality Assumption

#### 7.2.1 Histogram of Residuals

```{r}
residuals = resid(bestModel)
hist(residuals, main="Histogram of Residuals - Best Model", xlab="Residuals", col="lightblue", border="black", breaks = 30)
```

The histogram appears to be somewhat centered around zero, which is
good. However, the shape does not perfectly follow a bell curve (normal
distribution). The bars are somewhat skewed—there seems to be a longer
right tail, suggesting potential positive skewness. Next, we will
confirm whether the residuals deviate from normality, using the Q-Q
Plot.

#### 7.2.2 Q-Q Plot of Residuals

```{r}
# Q-Q plot of residuals
qqnorm(residuals, main="Q-Q Plot of Residuals")
qqline(residuals, col="lightblue")
```

The points deviate significantly at both ends (left and right tails),
indicating non-normality in the residuals. The right tail (higher
values) has several points far above the line, suggesting the presence
of high-value outliers (potentially high-priced aircraft affecting the
model). The left tail (lower values) slightly deviates as well. Most
points near the center follow the red line well, which means most
residuals are approximately normal. Since the p-value is very small,
your residuals do not follow a normal distribution. This violates the
normality assumption in linear regression, which can impact hypothesis
testing and confidence intervals.

#### 7.2.3 Residuals vs Fitted Plot

```{r}
# Plot Residuals vs Fitted Values
plot(fitted(bestModel), residuals, main="Residuals vs Fitted", xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals")
abline(h=0, col="red")
```

The Residuals vs. Fitted plot shows signs of heteroscedasticity, as
residuals exhibit increasing variance for larger fitted values,
indicating that the model struggles to predict high aircraft prices
accurately. Additionally, a slight curvature suggests potential
non-linearity, meaning the model might be missing key interaction or
polynomial effects. There are also outliers that could be influential
observations, impacting the model’s stability. These issues violate
regression assumptions, potentially leading to unreliable standard
errors and biased predictions.

Overall, this Residuals vs. Fitted plot confirms that your model suffers
from heteroscedasticity and possible outliers. Applying log
transformation, WLS regression, or robust regression techniques should
improve the model’s reliability

### 7.3. Independence Assumption

In linear regression, the error terms (𝜖₁, 𝜖₂, 𝜖₃, etc.) should not be
related to each other. This means the value of one error doesn’t give
any clue about the next one. When this assumption is violated (e.g.,
errors are correlated), it often happens in time-series data, where
observations are taken over time. As we do not have any time series data
or spatial variable, we considered to plot the residuals vs engine_type
category.

```{r Independence Assumption}
residuals <- residuals(bestModel)  
residuals_data <- data.frame(Residuals = residuals, EngineType = AircraftData$engine_type)
boxplot(Residuals ~ EngineType, data = residuals_data, 
        main = "Residuals vs Engine Type",
        xlab = "Engine Type",
        ylab = "Residuals",
        col = "lightblue")
```

The box plot above indicates that the residuals for different engine
types are centered around zero and do not display any noticeable
patterns. Therefore, the independence assumption is satisfied.

### 7.4. Equal Variance Assumption

```{r Equal Variance Assumption}
bestModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

#residuals plot
plot(bestModel, which=1) 

#scale-location plot
plot(bestModel, which=3) 
```

```{r Equal Variance Assumption: BP test}
#The Breusch-Pagan Test
bptest(bestModel)
```

H~0~: heteroscedasticity is not present (homoscedasticity)

H~1~: heteroscedasticity is present

Here we reject the null hypothesis (p-value \< 0.05), so we conclude we
do have heteroscedasticity. Maybe we can try a higher order model to get
rid of this issue.

To resolve we can apply log transformation

### 7.4.1. Log transformation

```{r Equal Variance Assumption- Log transformation}
AircraftData$log_price = log(AircraftData$price)
bestModel_log <- lm(log_price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

bptest(bestModel_log)
plot(bestModel_log, which=3)
```

```{r Equal Variance Assumption- sqrt transformation}
#sqrt transformation
AircraftData$sqrt_price = sqrt(AircraftData$price)
bestModel_sqrt <- lm(sqrt_price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)

bptest(bestModel_sqrt)
plot(bestModel_sqrt, which=3)
```

p-value \< 2.2e-16 is less than 0.05, so we reject H~0~. Therefor there
exists hetroscedasticity. Now we apply Box-Cox transformations.

### 7.4.2. Box-Cox transformations

```{r Equal Variance Assumption- Box-Cox transformations}
bc=boxcox(bestModel,lambda=seq(-5,5))
bestlambda=bc$x[which(bc$y==max(bc$y))]
(bestlambda)
#The Breusch-Pagan Test
bptest(bestModel)

bcmodel=lm((((price^0.8585859)-1)/0.8585859) ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)
#summary(bcmodel)
bptest(bcmodel)

```

The Box-Cox transformation (using λ = 0.8586) helped to adjust the
dependent variable, but it did not completely solve the
heteroscedasticity problem in the model.

### 7.5. Outliers

```{r Outliers}
bestModel = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +
                        factor(engine_type) * engine_power + factor(engine_type) * max_speed + 
                        factor(engine_type) * cruise_speed + factor(engine_type) * wing_span +  
                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = AircraftData)


plot(bestModel,which=5)
AircraftData[cooks.distance(bestModel)>0.5,]
#which =4 only prints the cook distance plot. 
plot(bestModel,pch=18,col="lightblue",which=c(4)) 

#cook distance
AircraftData[cooks.distance(bestModel)>0.5,]

#leverages points plots
plot(bestModel,pch=18,col="lightblue",which=c(4)) #which =4 only prints the cook distance plot.
```

From here you can see that data point 47 is an influential case and we
need to work for that point so find cook distance. Observation 47 (0.65)
well above this threshold, indicating they are highly influential
points.

```{r}
lev=hatvalues(bestModel)
p = length(coef(bestModel))
n = nrow(AircraftData)
outlier2p = lev[lev>(2*p/n)]
outlier3p = lev[lev>(3*p/n)]
print("h_I>2p/n, outliers are")
print(outlier2p)
print(outlier3p)
```

Here 47 leverage point is 0.4346 and cook distance 0.65 so this is high
influential points and remove and check the result.

```{r Outliers removed}
#ouliers removed
AircraftData_NoOutliers = read.csv("C:/603/aircraft_price_no_outliers.csv")
sum(is.na(AircraftData_NoOutliers))
Aircraft_NoOutliers = na.omit(AircraftData_NoOutliers)

bestModel_NoOutliers = lm(price ~ factor(engine_type) + engine_power + I(cruise_speed^2) +
                        max_speed + cruise_speed + stall_speed + wing_span +

                        engine_power * max_speed + engine_power * cruise_speed + engine_power * wing_span  + 
                        max_speed * wing_span + cruise_speed * stall_speed,   data = Aircraft_NoOutliers)

## 8. Summary

### 8.1. Key Findings

Our best model predicts aircraft price based on engine type, performance
metrics such as cruise speed, engine power, stall speed, max speed, and
design factors like wing span. On analysis of the best model, we can see
the below findings:

1.  Engine Type:

    Jet type is the reference category

    Piston price is less than Jet by approximately 4.39 million USD

    Propjet price is less than Jet by approximately 2.76 million USD

2.  Cruise Speed impact:

    Linear term: negative effect on price

    Quadratic term: positive effect with exponential price increase at
    higher speeds

3.  Negative Effects: for stall speed and wing span

4.  Interaction terms:

    For Propjets, Higher max speed benefits, but higher cruise speed
    reduces price.

    Engine Power + Max Speed / Cruise Speed: Slight negative price
    impact

    Max Speed + Wing Span: Contributes positively to price

**Jet Engines:** Predicted price is 5,823,241.56 USD when all other
variables are zero. Jets do not experience price reductions like piston
engines or propjets. Negative effects come from stall speed and wing
span, with mixed interactions across other factors.

**Piston Engines:** Predicted price is about 4.39 million USD lower than
jets. Engine power decreases price by 981 units per unit increase, while
max speed and cruise speed positively impact price. Greater wing span
also increases price, but stall speed and wing span have overall
negative effects.

**PropJets Engines:** Predicted price is approximately 2.76 million USD
lower than jets. Engine power reduces price by 2,284.54 units per unit
increase, but max speed and wing span increase price. Higher cruise
speed slightly decreases price, while stall speed and wing span have
negative effects.

### 8.2. Improvements

#### 8.2.1 To address hetroscedasticity for Equal Variance 

Since the best model has not meet with homoscedasticity or equal
variance assumption. It could be resolved by doing some of the following
methods

1.  applying appropriate transformation of dependent variable (other
    than log, sqrt. Since we tried it)
2.  Use WLS instead of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to assign weights to
    observations inversely proportional to their variance.
3.  Check for omitted variables by introducing variables may help
    capture the relationships causing heteroscedasticity
4.  Identify and consider removing influential observations or outliers
    that might cause variance issues.

#### 8.2.2 Reduction of terms with VIF \> 5 

Given that the predictors engine_power and cruise_speed are
statistically and theoretically significant for our dataset, we chose to
retain them despite their VIF being greater than 5. While these terms
hold theoretical importance, removing them might yield alternative
models capable of predicting prices effectively. Further analysis is
necessary to evaluate their relevance, and we suggest examining whether
the newly developed model could address the heteroscedasticity problem.
